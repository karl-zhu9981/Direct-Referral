Triss score is calculated based on the following:

-Patient age in years

RTS:
    Revised Trauma Score = (0.9368 * GCS Value) + (0.7326 * SBP Value) + (0.2908 * RR Value)
    -GCS:
        GCS Score is based on the calculator on this website: https://www.mdapp.co/glasgow-coma-scale-gcs-calculator-108/

        *The GCS scale results vary from 3 to 15, the higher the scale, the more increased level of consciousness.
        Observations are recorded every half hour after admission and for two more hours when the scale reaches 15.
        After this, observations are taken every hour for the next 4 hours and then 2 hourly until discharge.

        GCS calculator questionnare:
            1. Eye opening
            -Spontaneous (+4)
            -In response to sound (+3)
            -In response to pressure (+2)
            -No eye opening (+1)
            2. Verbal response
            -Orientated response (+5)
            -Confused response (+4)
            -Inappropriate words (+3)
            -Incomprehensible speech (+2)
            -No verbal response (+1)
            3. Motor response
            -Obeying commands (+6)
            -Localizes pain stimulation (+5)
            -Withdrawal from pain (+4)
            -Flexor response to pain (+3)
            -Extension response to pain (+2)
            -No motor response (+1)
    -Systolic blood pressure (BP): mmHg
    -Respiratory rate: breaths per min
ISS:
    ISS is based on the top 3 scores squared and added up. 
    -Each point can have a maximum score of 6. 
    -If any point has a score of 6, ISS Score is automatically 75
    -else, ISS = hi1^2 + hi2^2 + hi3^2

    -Head and neck injury
    -Face injury
    -Thorax injury
    -Abdomen injury
    -Extremities injury
    -External injury

FINAL SCORE CALCULATOR:

TRISS score = 1/(1+ e-b)
where b = b0 + b1 x RTS + b2 x ISS + b3 x AgeIndex
    b(Blunt) = -0.4499 + 0.8085 x RTS - 0.0835 x ISS - 1.7430 x AgeIndex
    b(Penetrating) = -2.5355 + 0.9934 x RTS - 0.0651 x ISS - 1.1360 x AgeIndex
